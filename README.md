## Additional notes
This unofficial video addon is the continuation of the work done by [WinSomeHax](https://github.com/winsomehax/plugin.video.bitchute). This is not a fork but a transfer of maintainership. To better promote the ideals of freedom, privacy and decentralization the main repo has shifted away from Github and is now hosted [here](https://git.slavegrid.com/plugin.video.bitchute).

## Support Bitchute
Help do your part in the alt-media revolution. Bitchute.com has [memberships](https://www.bitchute.com/membership/) as low as $5 a month and [merchandise](https://www.stickermule.com/bitchute). As an added benefit subscribers can use this addon guilt free!
